Dear Half-Life Advanced Effects (HLAE) user,


You can retrieve the latest HLAE, infos, report bugs and post suggestions here:
https://www.advancedfx.org/


Epilepsy warning:
	
	This software will cause fast changing colors and images on your screen.

VAC warning:
	
	The HLAE tool is technically a hack, therefore you should use it for making
	movies / watching demos only. Joining VAC protected servers with HLAE might
	get you VAC banned.

Using HLAE:
	
	Extract all contents of this archive into a folder you like.
	You should not extract into the game's folder, this is not necessary.
	
	We suggest using Steam's Offline Mode.
	Please stick to the manuals and tutorials on the web for more information.


Disclaimer:
	
	Altered versions must be clearly marked as such and must not be
	misrepresented as being the original software.
	
	This software is for your enjoyment and you are using it at your own risk.


Sincerely,
your Half-Life Advanced Effects team.
