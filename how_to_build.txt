Notice:
  We recommend using GIT Bash of https://git-scm.com/ to obtain the HLAE source
  code and also for applying the .patch files to libraries where neccessary.

[X] Download and install Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2022, which you can
    obtain for free from https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/ .
    - Select Workloads - Desktop & Mobile - .NET Desktop Development
    - Select Workloads - Desktop & Mobile - Desktop development with C++
	- Select Individual Components - .NET Framework 4.6.2 targeting pack
    - You'll need to install Wix Toolset Visual Studio 2022 Extension from
      within Visual Studio afterwards.

[X]	Obtain Python 3 from https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/ .
	We used python-3.12.1-amd64, but any 3.8 or newer 3 should do.
	You will need to do the custom installation
	with pip and py launcher.
	
[X]	Obtain GNU gettext Windows binaries from https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/ .
	We used gettext0.20.1-iconv1.16-shared-64.exe .
	
[X] Install WiX Toolset from https://github.com/wixtoolset/wix3/releases
	We used WiX Toolset v3.11.2.

[X] Obtain the HLAE source code from https://github.com/advancedfx/advancedfx into a
    folder you like, we'll call it <HLAESRC> from now on (by that I mean
    extract it so that you end up with the files like advancedfx.sln and directories
    in C:\<HLAESRC>\advancedfx folder).
    We recommend using the GIT Bash to obtain the source code, so you can
    easily fetch and merge updates from the advancedfx repository:
    cd /c/<HLAESRC>
    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/advancedfx/advancedfx.git

[X] Open Visual Studio 2022 Developer Command Prompt:
	cd C:\<HLAESRC>\advancedfx\
	mkdir build
	cd build
	mkdir Release
	cd Release
	cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -T "v143" -A "Win32" ../..
	cmake --build . --config Release -v -- -r
	cmake --install . --config Release -v
	
	(For Debug builds replace Release with Debug in the instructions above.)

[X] After that the installer and the zip can be found in "C:\<HLAESRC>\advancedfx\build\Release".

[X] Things you should do before releasing a new version:
  - Update version in hlae/CMakeLists.txt
  - Update GUIDs in hlae/UpdateCheck.cs
  - Update Product Version in installer/HlaeCore/Product.wxs
  - Update version in installer/setup/Bundle.wxs
